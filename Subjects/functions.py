#Functions are collections of code which have a specific task.
def say_hi():
    print("Hi!")

#Functions need the "calling". They have to be called to start to work.
#Some functions can include parameters. I can put how many parameters I want. Eg: def say_hi(name): print("Hi " +name). Everytime that I want to run this functions, I will have to give a parameter, in this case, a name (str).

if __name__ == "__main__":
    say_hi()
